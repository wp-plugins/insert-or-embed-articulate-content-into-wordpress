== Description ==

This plugin will add a new toolbar icon (the letter 'a') next to the 'Add Media' button on the Edit Post and Edit Page pages.  Upon clicking this toolbar icon, you will have the ability to upload your published Articulate content as a ZIP file.  Once uploaded, the plugin will automatically extract the content, find the approriate .html file, and add code to your post or page that will display your Articulate content as an iframe or a lightbox.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use this to embed Articulate content? =

Check out this screencast:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwcIsxpkvM4

= Does this work with Articulate Storyline content? =

Yes, it works with all versions of Articulate Storyline including Storyline 2.

= Why does the upload never finish or I get a -1 error message? =

In order to resolve this issue, you need to update your php.ini file in your wp-admin folder to reflect the following: 

post_max_size = 50M

max_execution_time = 60

max_input_time = 60

upload_max_filesize = 50M


(These settings will vary depending upon your server and content.  You may need to contact your hosting company to make these changes.) 

= If I delete the plugin, what happens to the content that I've uploaded? =

The uploaded content is saved into the wp-content / uploads / articulate_uploads folder on your site.  Thus, your uploaded content will not be removed if you delete this plugin.
